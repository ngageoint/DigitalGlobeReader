## DigitalGlobe Reader

This C++ class is a "bare bones" class designed to read DigitalGlobe imagery files (GeoTiff) and meta-data (XML) files. The class has the ability to load imagery data into a set of arrays (1 per band) and to project the imagery onto a ground plane (it acts like a slide projector and projects the image onto a 2D screen). 

Documentation is extensive both within the documentation files in this repo and inline within the class.
